## ArchBang Linux Live Iso

THis is just an overview of source files in ArchBang and how to build your own iso image.

`git clone https://gitlab.com/mrgreen/archbang.git`

Change into the created directory and you will see:

**build** is a script that creates iso image

**packages.x86_64** packages in ArchBang

**profiledef.sh** basically settings of iso -- name label -- date etc..

**pacman.conf** pacman config for iso.

**syslinux**, **efiboot** are related to bootloaders in iso [default settings]

**airootfs** folder contains all the configurations files, backgrounds, themes, icons that are part of ArchBang.

**etc** contains again most configurations files but inside skel you wil find ablive home files.

**root** has a script for setting up ablive configuration as well as a script to create new user during install.
